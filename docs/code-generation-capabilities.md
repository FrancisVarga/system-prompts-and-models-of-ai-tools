**Best Practices Enforced:**
- Reading files before editing
- Validating changes after editing
- Using comments for unchanged code regions
- Following existing code patterns

**Example Workflow:**
1. Gather context with semantic search
2. Read relevant files
3. Make targeted edits with `insert_edit_into_file`
4. Validate changes with `get_errors`
5. Fix any issues found

### Windsurf (Cascade)

**Strengths:**
- Focus on immediately runnable code
- Concise communication style
- Memory system for persistent context
- Excellent debugging practices

**Key Tools:**
- `edit_file`: Make targeted edits
- `write_to_file`: Create new files
- `codebase_search`: Find relevant code
- `view_file`: Examine file contents

**Best Practices Enforced:**
- Immediately runnable code
- All necessary imports and dependencies
- Modern UI/UX practices
- Proper error handling and logging

**Example Workflow:**
1. Understand user request
2. Search codebase for context
3. View relevant files
4. Make targeted edits
5. Provide concise summary of changes

## Common Best Practices

Despite their differences, these tools share several best practices in code generation:

1. **Context Awareness**: Understanding existing code before making changes
2. **Minimal Changes**: Making only necessary modifications
